## Project Overview

**Aura AI** is a chatbot that helps users by answering a wide variety of questions in real-time. It uses the **Gemini API** to provide accurate and relevant answers. The app is built with **React** for its interactive interface, and **CSS** for its design. 

One useful feature of Aura AI is that it keeps track of your recent questions, displaying them in a side-bar, so you can easily refer back to them. The project uses **Vite** for fast development and smooth performance.


## Features
- **Real-time Chatbot Responses**: Powered by the Gemini API to deliver accurate and context-aware answers.
- **Query History**: Stores recent prompts in a side-bar for easy navigation and reference.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled using CSS for a sleek, modern look.
- **Fast Development and Build**: Leveraging Vite for an optimized development environment with lightning-fast builds.
